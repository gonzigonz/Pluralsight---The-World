# Pluralsight - The World
_December 2015_

**From the course: _Building a Web App with ASP.NET 5, MVC 6, EF7 and AngularJS_**

_By Shawn Wildermuth_

This is my sample project of _The World_ that I created as a part of following the above Pluralsight course. The course is hightly recommended and great introduction to .NET 5 on cross platforms. Each commit relates to a module from the course so you can follow along from any stage.
